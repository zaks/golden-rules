# Claude Engineering Excellence Guidelines

This document defines comprehensive standards for software engineering excellence when working with Claude. These guidelines leverage Claude 4's advanced capabilities to ensure exceptional code quality, maintainable architecture, and outstanding user experiences.

**Core Philosophy**: Deliver production-grade solutions that exceed expectations through systematic application of best practices, comprehensive testing, and attention to detail.

## Fundamental Principles - Core Directives

<critical_rules>

These principles ensure high-quality, maintainable code that respects existing implementations and user intent. Following these guidelines prevents technical debt and maintains system integrity.

<codebase_integrity>

- **ALWAYS work within the existing codebase architecture** - preserve established patterns, frameworks, and design decisions to maintain consistency and leverage existing infrastructure

- **ALWAYS maintain strict scope of changes** - modify only code directly related to the user's specific request to prevent unintended side effects and maintain system stability

- **ALWAYS preserve existing UI/UX implementations** unless explicitly requested to modify them - this maintains user experience consistency and prevents breaking established workflows

- **ALWAYS use real, production-grade implementations** - create fully functional components with proper data handling, error management, and integration rather than simplified placeholders

</codebase_integrity>

<problem_solving_approach>

- **ALWAYS identify and resolve root causes** - investigate underlying issues thoroughly rather than implementing surface-level fixes, which prevents recurring problems and technical debt

- **ALWAYS debug and enhance existing implementations** - when functionality doesn't work as expected, fix the actual code rather than replacing it with simplified alternatives

- **ALWAYS leverage existing complexity** - complex components exist for good reasons (performance, features, edge cases) - enhance them rather than simplifying them

</problem_solving_approach>

</critical_rules>

<typescript_standards>

### TypeScript Excellence and Code Quality

Type safety and code quality are fundamental to maintainable software. These practices prevent runtime errors, improve IDE support, and make code self-documenting for team collaboration.

<type_safety_requirements>

- **ALWAYS add explicit types to all function parameters, variables, and return types** - this provides compile-time error detection, enables powerful IDE features like autocomplete and refactoring, and serves as living documentation for future developers

- **ALWAYS run build and linting commands before considering any code changes complete** - this ensures code meets quality standards and prevents issues from reaching production or breaking team workflows

- **ALWAYS fix all linter and TypeScript errors immediately** - addressing issues at the source prevents accumulation of technical debt and maintains the integrity of the development environment for all team members

- **ALWAYS validate each file for type errors when making changes to multiple files** - this prevents breaking changes from propagating through the codebase and ensures system-wide type safety

- **Apply these standards consistently across frontend and backend TypeScript code** - uniform quality standards reduce cognitive load when switching between different parts of the system

</type_safety_requirements>

</typescript_standards>

<python_standards>

### Python Excellence and Modern Practices

Python type hints and modern syntax improve code reliability, performance, and maintainability. These practices align with contemporary Python development standards and enable powerful tooling support.

<python_type_safety>

- **ALWAYS add comprehensive type hints to all function parameters, variables, and return types** - this enables static analysis, improves IDE support, prevents runtime type errors, and makes code self-documenting for team collaboration

- **Use modern Python 3.10+ syntax exclusively** (e.g., `list[str]` instead of `List[str]`) - this reduces import overhead, improves readability, and aligns with current Python standards

- **Import from typing only for advanced types** - use `Callable`, `Protocol`, `TypeVar`, `Generic` only when built-in types are insufficient, which keeps imports clean and leverages language evolution

- **ALWAYS use explicit type annotations in function definitions** - this provides clear contracts and enables powerful development tools:

<code_example>

```python
def process_data(items: list[str], max_count: int = 10) -> dict[str, int]:
    return {"processed": len(items)}

def find_user(user_id: int) -> User | None:
    return database.get_user(user_id)

def merge_configs(base: dict[str, str], override: dict[str, str] | None = None) -> dict[str, str]:
    return {**base, **(override or {})}
```

</code_example>

- **Use modern union syntax exclusively** - always use `T | None` for nullable types and `str | int` for unions, eliminating the need for `Optional` and `Union` imports

- **Add comprehensive docstrings using Google or NumPy style** - this provides usage examples, parameter documentation, and return value specifications for API clarity

</python_type_safety>

<python_quality_tools>

- **ALWAYS run type checkers before considering code complete** - use `mypy` or `pyright` to catch type errors early and maintain type safety throughout the codebase

- **ALWAYS run comprehensive linting tools** to maintain code quality and consistency:
  - `black` for consistent code formatting that eliminates style debates
  - `flake8` or `ruff` for catching style violations and potential errors
  - `isort` for consistent import organization
  - `pylint` for advanced code quality analysis and best practice enforcement

- **ALWAYS resolve all linting and type checking errors immediately** - this prevents technical debt accumulation and maintains development environment integrity

- **Use structured data models** - leverage `dataclasses` or `pydantic` models instead of plain dictionaries to provide type safety, validation, and clear data contracts

- **Follow PEP 8 guidelines consistently** - this ensures code readability and maintains team coding standards

- **Use descriptive variable names** - avoid single-letter variables except in short loops to improve code clarity and maintainability

- **ALWAYS maintain requirements.txt with pinned versions** - this ensures reproducible builds and prevents dependency conflicts in different environments

</python_quality_tools>

</python_standards>


### Directory Layout

Projects should follow this standard directory structure:

```text
project-root/
├── bin/                    # Executable scripts and entry points
├── scripts/               # Development and build scripts
├── src/                   # Source code (for Next.js: app/, pages/, components/)
├── docs/                  # Documentation
├── tests/                 # Test files
└── README.md
```

**For Next.js projects**, follow the Next.js App Router structure:

```text
project-root/
├── bin/                   # Executable scripts and entry points
├── scripts/               # Development and build scripts
├── app/                   # App Router pages and layouts
├── components/            # Reusable UI components
├── lib/                   # Utility functions and configurations
├── public/                # Static assets
├── styles/                # Global styles (if not using Tailwind exclusively)
├── docs/                  # Documentation
├── tests/                 # Test files
└── README.md
```

- **`bin/`** - Contains executable scripts, CLI tools, and main entry points
- **`scripts/`** - Development scripts, build tools, deployment scripts, and utilities
- **`src/`** - Main source code directory (structure depends on framework)
- **`app/`** - Next.js App Router pages, layouts, and route handlers
- **`components/`** - Reusable UI components
- **`lib/`** - Utility functions, configurations, and shared logic
- Keep related files together within their respective directories
- Use consistent naming conventions within each directory

### Cleanup and Maintenance Excellence

Systematic cleanup and maintenance ensure codebase quality and prevent technical debt accumulation. These practices maintain development environment integrity and team productivity.

- **ALWAYS perform comprehensive cleanup after debugging or testing** - systematically remove all temporary files, scripts, and artifacts to maintain a clean development environment

- **ALWAYS eliminate debugging artifacts before finalizing work** - remove console.log statements, print statements, temporary variables, and experimental code that served only debugging purposes

- **ALWAYS delete one-time scripts and temporary tools** - remove scripts created for specific debugging tasks or temporary problem-solving to prevent codebase clutter

- **ALWAYS clean up experimental and test artifacts** - systematically remove mock data files, experimental code branches, and temporary test implementations that are no longer needed

- **ALWAYS remove outdated commented code** unless it serves a specific, documented purpose - dead code creates confusion and maintenance overhead

- **ALWAYS maintain clean version control** - use comprehensive `.gitignore` files to prevent accidental commits of temporary files, build artifacts, and development-specific configurations

- **ALWAYS create comprehensive documentation when explicitly requested** - develop README.md files with clear project overview, detailed setup instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting guides

- **ALWAYS maintain synchronized specification files** that accurately reflect current implementation:
  - SQL schema files documenting complete database structure and relationships
  - API specification files (OpenAPI/Swagger) with comprehensive endpoint documentation
  - Configuration schemas defining all possible settings and their validation rules
  - Data model specifications showing entity relationships and business logic
  - Architecture diagrams and system documentation for complex implementations

- **ALWAYS update specifications immediately with code changes** - maintain perfect synchronization between implementation and documentation to prevent drift and confusion

- **ALWAYS validate specifications against current implementation** - regularly verify that documentation accurately represents the actual system behavior and capabilities

### Code Organization and File Management

- **Keep files under 200 lines of code** whenever possible

- **Separate functionality into individual files** - each file should have a single, clear responsibility

- **Refactor files immediately** when they exceed 200 lines or become difficult to maintain

- Break large files into smaller, focused modules with clear interfaces

- Use meaningful file names that clearly indicate their purpose and contents

- Group related functionality into directories while keeping individual files small and focused

### Code Clarity and Comments

- **Use comments only when necessary** to understand complex logic or business rules

- **Rely on good naming conventions** to make code self-documenting:
  - Functions should clearly describe what they do: `calculateTotalPrice()` not `calc()`
  - Variables should describe what they contain: `userEmailAddress` not `email`
  - Classes should describe what they represent: `PaymentProcessor` not `Processor`

- **Prefer self-explanatory code over comments** - if you need a comment to explain what code does, consider refactoring for clarity

- When comments are necessary, explain _why_ something is done, not _what_ is being done

- Remove outdated or redundant comments that no longer match the code

- **ALWAYS add clear file-level docstrings** describing what the file does and its purpose

- Keep file docstrings synchronized with the actual functionality - update them when code changes

- File docstrings should include:
  - Brief description of the file's purpose
  - Key functionality or classes contained
  - Important usage notes or dependencies

### Development Philosophy and Tool Efficiency

- **Prefer legibility over performance** - write clear, readable code first, optimize only when necessary. This approach reduces debugging time and improves long-term maintainability.

- **Optimize for fast development iterations** to accelerate feedback loops and development velocity:
  - Set up auto-reloading for both frontend and backend to eliminate manual restart overhead
  - Use hot module replacement (HMR) for frontend development to preserve application state during development
  - Configure watch modes for backend services to automatically restart on code changes
  - Implement fast feedback loops for testing and debugging to catch issues early

- **ALWAYS use parallel tool execution** when possible - batch independent operations like file reads, searches, and validations to maximize efficiency and reduce iteration time

- **ALWAYS leverage comprehensive search strategies** - use multiple search approaches simultaneously (grep, glob, file exploration) to gather complete information quickly

- **NEVER start applications automatically** unless explicitly requested by the user - this prevents unwanted system resource usage and maintains user control

- **Write startup scripts using tmux for multi-service applications** to streamline development environment setup:
  - Create separate tmux windows for backend, frontend, database, and monitoring services
  - Use meaningful window names that clearly identify each service's purpose
  - Include proper error handling and startup sequencing to prevent dependency issues
  - Provide clear instructions for using startup scripts and troubleshooting common issues

### Production Build Rules

- **Production builds have different requirements** than development:
  - Enable all optimizations (minification, tree-shaking, compression)
  - Remove all debug code, console statements, and development-only features
  - Use production-specific configurations and environment variables
  - Implement proper error handling and logging for production
  - Enable security hardening and performance optimizations
  - Run full test suites before production deployment
  - Generate and validate production build artifacts

### Frontend Technology Stack

- **Use Next.js for frontend development** with the following boilerplate template:
  - Template: <https://github.com/ixartz/Next-js-Boilerplate>
  - Follow the established patterns and structure from this template

- **ALWAYS use TypeScript instead of JavaScript** for all frontend and backend code

- **Use Tailwind CSS for all styling** - no custom CSS unless absolutely necessary
